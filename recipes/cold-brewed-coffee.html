    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee brewed slowly in cold water is less acidic than hot brewed. You can
      use this concentrate straight over ice or microwave half a mug coffee and
      then add a half cup of boiling water for quick hot coffee. Go crazy,
      develop your own ratio of coffee to water for your custom brew.
